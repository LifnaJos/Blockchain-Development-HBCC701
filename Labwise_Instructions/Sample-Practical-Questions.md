# Sample Practical Questions for Blockchain Set Up Lab
1. Write a Solidity contract to implement a simple withdrawal mechanism that allows any user to deposit Ether and then withdraw only their own balance.
2. Create a contract that stores a single unsigned integer and allows users to set and get the value.
3. Build a contract with an owner address and restrict a function so only the owner can call it.
4. Develop a contract that adds two numbers together using a public function and returns the sum.
5. Implement a contract to store an array of numbers and add new values to the array.
6. Write a contract that uses a mapping to associate Ethereum addresses with balances and provides functions to update and read balances.
7. Define a struct in a contract to represent a Person (with name and age), and a function to update its data.
8. Write a contract with a function that checks if an input number is greater than 10, returning a message accordingly.
9. Create a contract that uses a for loop to sum integers from 1 to n and returns the result.
10. Build a program demonstrating the use of public and private state variables and accessing their values.
11. Develop a contract containing a payable function, so users can send Ether to the contract and check the contract’s balance.
12. Write a contract demonstrating fallback and receive functions, both triggered by sending Ether with/without data.
13. Create a contract with both view and pure functions, and explain their use with example functions.
14. Implement an enum type in a contract that tracks the status of an item, with functions to change and read its status.
15. Write a contract that emits an event when a state variable is updated, and retrieve the state variable value.
16. Create a contract that uses inheritance. Define two contracts—one parent and one child—and demonstrate how the child contract can access or override a function in the parent contract.
17. Develop a Solidity contract that demonstrates the use of an internal function and an external function, and explains the difference between their usage.​
18. Write a contract that maintains a counter variable and provides functions to increment, decrement, and reset the counter, ensuring it cannot go below zero.
